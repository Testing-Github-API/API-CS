## Design Rules

### URI Format

* Forward slash separator (/) must be used to indicate a hierarchical
relationship 

* A trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs

* Hyphens (-) should be used to improve the readability of URIs

* Underscores (_) should not be used in URIs

* Lowercase letters should be preferred in URI paths

* File extensions should not be included in URIs

### URI Authority Design

* Consistent subdomain names should be used for your APIs

* Consistent subdomain names should be used for your client developer portal

### URI Path Design

* A singular noun should be used for document names

* A plural noun should be used for collection names

* A plural noun should be used for store names

* A verb or verb phrase should be used for controller names

* Variable path segments may be substituted with identity-based
values

* CRUD function names should not be used in URIs

### URI Query Design

* The query component of a URI may be used to filter collections or stores

* The query component of a URI should be used to paginate collection or store results

### Request Methods

* GET and POST must not be used to tunnel other request methods

* GET must be used to retrieve a representation of a resource

* HEAD should be used to retrieve response headers

* PUT must be used to both insert and update a stored resource

* PUT must be used to update mutable resources

* POST must be used to create a new resource in a collection

* POST must be used to execute controllers

* DELETE must be used to remove a resource from its parent

* OPTIONS should be used to retrieve metadata that describes a resource’s available interactions

### Response Status Codes

* 200 (“OK”) should be used to indicate nonspecific success

* 200 (“OK”) must not be used to communicate errors in the response body

* 201 (“Created”) must be used to indicate successful resource creation

* 202 (“Accepted”) must be used to indicate successful start of an
asynchronous action

* 204 (“No Content”) should be used when the response body is
intentionally empty

* 301 (“Moved Permanently”) should be used to relocate resources

* 302 (“Found”) should not be used

* 303 (“See Other”) should be used to refer the client to a different URI

* 304 (“Not Modified”) should be used to preserve bandwidth

* 307 (“Temporary Redirect”) should be used to tell clients to resubmit the request to another URI

* 400 (“Bad Request”) may be used to indicate nonspecific failure

* 401 (“Unauthorized”) must be used when there is a problem with the client’s credentials

* 403 (“Forbidden”) should be used to forbid access regardless of
authorization state

* 404 (“Not Found”) must be used when a client’s URI cannot be mapped to a resource

* 405 (“Method Not Allowed”) must be used when the HTTP method is not supported

* 406 (“Not Acceptable”) must be used when the requested media type cannot be served

* 409 (“Conflict”) should be used to indicate a violation of resource state

* 412 (“Precondition Failed”) should be used to support conditional
operations

* 415 (“Unsupported Media Type”) must be used when the media type of a request’s payload cannot be processed

* 500 (“Internal Server Error”) should be used to indicate API
malfunction

### HTTP Headers

* Content-Type must be used

* Content-Length should be used

* Last-Modified should be used in responses

* ETag should be used in responses

* Stores must support conditional PUT requests

* Location must be used to specify the URI of a newly created resource

* Cache-Control, Expires, and Date response headers should be used to encourage caching

* Cache-Control, Expires, and Pragma response headers may be used to discourage caching

* Caching should be encouraged

*  Expiration caching headers should be used with 200 (“OK”) responses

* Expiration caching headers may optionally be used with 3xx and 4xx responses

* Custom HTTP headers must not be used to change the behavior of
HTTP methods

### Media Type Design

* Application-specific media types should be used

* Media type negotiation should be supported when multiple representations are available

* Media type selection using a query parameter may be supported

### Message Body Format

* JSON should be supported for resource representation

* JSON must be well-formed

* XML and other formats may optionally be used for resource
representation

* Additional envelopes must not be created

### Hypermedia Representation

* A consistent form should be used to represent links

* A consistent form should be used to represent link relations

* A consistent form should be used to advertise links

* A self link should be included in response message body
representations

* Minimize the number of advertised “entry point” API URIs

* Links should be used to advertise a resource’s available actions in a state-sensitive manner

### Media Type Representation

* A consistent form should be used to represent media type formats

* A consistent form should be used to represent media type schemas

### Error Representation

* A consistent form should be used to represent errors

* A consistent form should be used to represent error responses

* Consistent error types should be used for common error conditions

### Versioning

* New URIs should be used to introduce new concepts

* Schemas should be used to manage representational form versions

* Entity tags should be used to manage representational state versions

### Security

*  OAuth may be used to protect resources

* API management solutions may be used to protect resources

### Response Representation Composition

* The query component of a URI should be used to support partial
responses

* The query component of a URI should be used to embed linked
resources

### JavaScript Clients

* JSONP should be supported to provide multi-origin read access from JavaScript

* CORS should be supported to provide multi-origin read/write access from JavaScript
